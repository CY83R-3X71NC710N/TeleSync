# TeleSync
Unlimited storage utilizing telegram with folder sync and file splitting. Fast CLI Interface.

# Why create this?
To clarify, many other solutions for backups are not "set and forget," which can be problematic because backups need to be consistently run on a schedule. That's why I created Telesync, which combines encrypted files, file splitting, folder sync, and scheduled runs into a single Python script for a more efficient and reliable backup system.
